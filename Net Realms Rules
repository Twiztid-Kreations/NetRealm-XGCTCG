NetRealm: Clash of Realities - Official Rules

NetRealm: Clash of Realities draws inspiration from the structure and gameplay mechanics of Magic: The Gathering but introduces its own thematic twists, unique systems, and strategic elements. Below is a comprehensive rule set for NetRealm.

1. Core Concepts and Game Objective

1.1 The Goal

Each player takes on the role of a WorldWeaver, wielding the power of Nodes (representing energy sources) to summon digital creatures, Relics, and cast powerful algorithms (spells). The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent’s Core Integrity (life total) from 20 to 0.

1.2 Deck Construction

A deck must contain at least 60 cards but can exceed this amount.

A deck may only have four copies of any single card (except for basic Nodes).

A deck can utilize cards from up to three Domains (energy types) unless specified otherwise.

2. The Card Types

2.1 Units

Units are the primary entities summoned by the WorldWeaver. These include creatures from the Domains (e.g., Viral Spirits, 8-Bit Knights, and Glitch Wraiths).

Power/Toughness: Units have two numbers, Power (damage dealt) and Toughness (damage sustained before destruction).

Activation Abilities: Some Units have abilities that can be activated by paying energy or other costs.

Keywords: Units may possess special traits such as Viral (spreads effects) or Hardened (damage resistance).

2.2 Algorithms (Spells)

Algorithms represent one-time effects, commands, or disruptions.

Algorithms can be cast during specific phases of the turn (see Turn Structure).

Some Algorithms have conditions or additional costs (e.g., sacrificing a Unit).

2.3 Relics (Artifacts)

Relics are permanent structures or items within the NetRealm, offering passive or activated abilities.

Relics remain on the field until destroyed or exiled.

Some Relics may have charges that deplete with use.

2.4 Nodes (Lands)

Nodes are the sources of energy for casting and summoning.

Each Node corresponds to a Domain (e.g., Coding, Meme, Creep, etc.).

Tapping a Node generates one energy of the corresponding Domain’s type.

Some Nodes have additional effects, such as producing multiple energy or conditional bonuses.

2.5 WorldWeavers (Planeswalkers)

WorldWeavers are powerful avatars of the player, representing their presence in the NetRealm.

Each WorldWeaver card has loyalty counters, which can be increased or decreased by activating abilities.

If a WorldWeaver’s loyalty counters reach zero, they are removed from the battlefield.

3. Game Zones

The game is divided into several distinct zones:

Library: The player’s deck of cards.

Hand: Cards drawn by the player, hidden from the opponent.

Battlefield: The active area where Units, Relics, Nodes, and WorldWeavers reside.

Graveyard: A discard pile for destroyed or used cards.

Exile Zone: A separate area for cards removed from the game.

Stack: A temporary zone for resolving Algorithms and abilities in order.

4. Turn Structure

Each turn is divided into distinct phases. Players alternate taking turns until the game ends.

4.1 Turn Phases

Start Phase:

Untap Step: Untap all tapped Nodes, Units, and other permanents.

Upkeep Step: Trigger any effects that occur during upkeep.

Draw Step: The active player draws one card.

Main Phase (Pre-combat):

Players may cast Algorithms, summon Units, play Relics, and activate abilities.

Only one Node may be played per turn unless otherwise stated.

Combat Phase:

Declare attackers.

Declare blockers (opponent assigns blocking Units).

Resolve damage.

Main Phase (Post-combat):

Players may cast additional spells, summon Units, or play Relics.

End Phase:

Trigger end-of-turn effects.

Discard down to the maximum hand size (usually seven).

5. Summoning and Casting

5.1 Tapping Nodes

To summon a Unit or cast an Algorithm, you must tap Nodes to generate the required energy cost.

Example: A Unit with a cost of “2 Coding, 1 Colorless” requires two Coding energy and one energy of any type.

5.2 Domain Energy

Energy generated by Nodes corresponds to the Domains (e.g., Coding, Meme, etc.).

Colorless energy can be used to pay any generic energy cost.

5.3 Stacking and Resolving Effects

The Stack resolves abilities and spells in "last in, first out" order.

Opponents may respond to spells or abilities by placing their own spells or effects on the Stack.

6. Combat

6.1 Declaring Attackers

During the combat phase, the active player declares which Units are attacking.

Units cannot attack the turn they are summoned unless they have Haste.

6.2 Declaring Blockers

The defending player assigns blocking Units to attackers.

Each blocking Unit may block one attacker unless otherwise stated.

6.3 Combat Damage

Units deal damage equal to their Power to the opposing Unit or player.

Excess damage does not carry over unless the attacking Unit has Trample.

7. Keywords and Abilities

NetRealm features numerous keywords that define Unit abilities, Relic effects, and Algorithm behaviors. Below are some of the most prominent:

7.1 Keywords for Units

Haste: Can attack or use activated abilities the turn it is summoned.

Trample: Excess combat damage is dealt to the defending player.

Viral: Spreads its effect to all compatible targets on the battlefield.

Hardened: Reduces all incoming damage by 1.

Stealth: Cannot be targeted by opponents until it attacks or activates an ability.

7.2 Relic Abilities

Charged: Relic has limited uses, represented by charge counters.

Persistent: Effect remains active as long as the Relic is on the battlefield.

7.3 Algorithm Types

Interrupt: Can be played in response to another spell or ability.

Enhance: Temporarily boosts Units or Relics.

Disrupt: Counters or removes cards from play.

8. Building a Strategy

8.1 Synergizing Domains

Players can mix and match up to three Domains to build unique decks. Each Domain has a distinct flavor and strategy:

Coding: Precision and control; excels at countering and optimizing.

Meme: Chaotic and unpredictable; specializes in Viral effects and quick buffs.

Creep: Corruption and decay; strong debuffs and graveyard synergies.

Gaming: Aggression and tactics; powerful Units and combat tricks.

Drama: Emotional manipulation; excels at mind games and disrupting opponents.

Movie: Cinematic storytelling; features grand, flashy effects.

Colorless: Neutral utility; adaptable but less specialized.

8.2 WorldWeaver Utilization

WorldWeavers are game-changers. Players should build their decks around maximizing their chosen WorldWeaver’s abilities, protecting them while leveraging their powers.

9. Winning and Losing

9.1 Core Integrity

A player loses when their Core Integrity (life total) reaches 0.

9.2 Deck Exhaustion

If a player cannot draw a card from their Library, they lose the game.

9.3 Concessions

A player may concede the game at any time, resulting in their loss.
