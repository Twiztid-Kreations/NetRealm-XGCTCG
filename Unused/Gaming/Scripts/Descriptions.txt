Flavor Text: "The final fight is never fair. It’s always epic."
Prompt:
In the heart of a digital dungeon, two towering figures stand before each other. One is a massive cybernetic warrior, clad in glowing armor, with energy swords crackling in its hands. The other is an ancient, fire-breathing dragon, its body covered in runes and digital flames. They are facing off in a ruined coliseum, lit by shifting neon lights and a holographic sky. In the distance, broken platforms and glitching environments add to the chaotic feeling. Around them, the game’s HUD displays countdowns, glowing health bars, and damage indicators as if this is the final stage of a once-heroic quest. The environment is a blend of both futuristic and medieval, with bits of pixels flying off as each warrior prepares for their next move. The focus is on the dramatic face-off, the crackling energy around them painting a vivid story of a Final Boss Showdown in this ultimate gaming duel.

Casting Cost: 3G (3 Generic, 1 Gaming Energy)
Ability: Choose a target player. That player reveals the top five cards of their deck. You may cast one of them for free, then shuffle the rest back into their deck.
Flavor Text: "Victory isn’t about strength; it’s about exploiting the system."
Prompt:
A character in a hoodie sits in front of a glowing monitor, their face obscured by the reflective glow of the screen. Their hands hover above the keyboard, an intense expression on their face as they access an immense system of code. Surrounding them are shards of glitching code—lines of binary and broken text swirling in an unstable vortex, their forms partially collapsing into the digital void. The room around them is filled with neon lights and holographic gaming memorabilia. The focus is on the character’s hands moving swiftly across the keys, casting quick glances between the monitor and their surroundings. Above their head, floating images of cards from the deck of their opponent flicker and pulse as they decide which one to steal. The theme of Glitching Victory is highlighted by the visual chaos in the room and the fragmented nature of the code surrounding the player, symbolizing how they’ve exploited the game’s glitches to secure a victory.

3. Uncommon: No Respawns
Casting Cost: 2G (2 Generic, 1 Gaming Energy)
Ability: All players must sacrifice a Unit they control. For each Unit sacrificed, the player loses 1 Integrity.
Flavor Text: "In this world, when you’re out, you’re out."
Prompt:
A dimly lit, ruined battlefield in a virtual arena is the backdrop of this scene. A colossal “Game Over” screen flickers ominously in the sky, a haunting reminder that this is the last round. Players in their gaming avatars, some bloodied and battered, are kneeling beside their fallen comrades—virtual soldiers, defeated and pixelated, their once-proud figures now crumbling into static. The ground beneath them is cracked and broken, with pieces of shattered armor and discarded weapons scattered across the grid. Glowing red lines trace the outlines of the fallen Units as they begin to disintegrate into code. The ominous figure of the No Respawns system hovers in the background, an algorithmic phantom that dictates the harsh rules of this digital universe. A subtle glow pulses from the edges of the image, emphasizing the despair of the players who realize there are no second chances here—only the cold reality of No Respawns.

4. Uncommon: Ultimate Power-Up
Casting Cost: 3G (3 Generic, 1 Gaming Energy)
Ability: Choose a target Unit you control. That Unit gains +4/+4 and gains trample until end of turn.
Flavor Text: "The true power lies in knowing when to use it."
Prompt:
A glowing, dynamic Ultimate Power-Up is given to a character standing in the center of a digital battlefield. This character, wearing bright futuristic armor with exaggerated glowing accents, clutches a glowing item in one hand. The environment around them is an arena where a dramatic, high-energy battle is taking place. The sky above is filled with falling energy orbs, each one representing a different type of power-up scattered across the map. The character’s outline is charged with brilliant energy, pulsating as the power-up affects their body, causing their size and power to increase exponentially. The Unit’s eyes glow with determination and intensity as they charge into the fray, their enemies’ health bars flickering in the background. The arena is littered with the remnants of previous battles: destroyed digital terrain, shattered platforms, and scattered power-up icons. Ultimate Power-Up is framed by the contrast of futuristic digital effects and the harsh, wild nature of the battle raging around the character, showing the destructive potential of this rare advantage.

5. Common: Combo Breaker
Casting Cost: 2G (2 Generic, 1 Gaming Energy)
Ability: Choose a target ability an opponent controls. That ability is countered, and the player loses 1 Integrity.
Flavor Text: "You thought you had it, but we have a counter."
Prompt:
The scene is set in the heart of a digital battle arena, where two players are locked in an intense face-off. The focus is on the Combo Breaker being triggered in the middle of a high-stakes move. One player, a character draped in digital armor, stands in defiance as a powerful glowing energy wave emanates from their hands, disrupting the opponent’s devastating combo move mid-flight. The Combo Breaker appears as a massive crack in the digital landscape, a glowing, fragmented shield blocking an incoming attack from the opposing player. Surrounding the action are bursts of pixelated energy and flashing numbers, the virtual world reacting to the abrupt disruption. The background shows the player’s digital avatar standing triumphantly, with a massive scoreboard looming in the distance, the opponent’s health bar dangerously low. This image conveys the satisfaction and power of counteracting an enemy’s plan at the perfect moment, just as the Combo Breaker counters the opponent's move and brings the battle to a turning point.

6. Common: Lag Spike
Casting Cost: 1G (1 Generic, 1 Gaming Energy)
Ability: Target player skips their next turn.
Flavor Text: "Just a brief moment in the game... or is it?"
Prompt:
A frustrated gamer is depicted in front of a glowing computer screen, their face twisted in annoyance as they watch their game world freeze. The environment around them is a surreal, distorted version of the usual battlefield. The grid has become warped and fragmented, with bright glitch effects distorting the background. A bold message appears across the screen: "Lag Spike!" in flashing neon letters. The player’s character is frozen mid-motion, their arms outstretched as if reaching for something just out of reach. In the background, various Lag Spike effects appear—digital creatures that appear to be running in slow motion, their movements jerky and disjointed, surrounded by lines of corrupted data. The intense energy of the scene shows the impact of this Lag Spike not only on the game world but also on the emotional state of the player, who can do nothing but watch as the game essentially halts, causing them to lose valuable time in their session. The imagery reflects the frustration, uncertainty, and disruption brought on by this unexpected delay in the virtual world.
