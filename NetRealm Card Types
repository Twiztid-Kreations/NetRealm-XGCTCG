Cardtypes

WorldWeavers (Planeswalker Equivalent)
WorldWeavers are powerful beings that travel between realms, weaving the fabric of the digital multiverse. These act as a centerpiece for decks, offering unique abilities and gameplay-altering effects.

Characteristics:

Have Starting Firewall (equivalent to loyalty points).
Abilities are triggered through a cost mechanic called "Threads," representing their influence across realms.
Each deck can only include one WorldWeaver, and they must match at least one of your deck's energy types.
Example WorldWeaver:

Zyx, Viral Architect (Meme/Energy)
Firewall: 5
+1: Spread a Viral Effect onto one enemy Unit (it gets -1/-1 each turn).
-2: Summon a 3/3 Meme Construct with “When this Unit dies, deal 2 damage to the opponent’s Firewall.”
-7: All opponents discard their hands, and you draw 7 cards.

2. Units (Monster Equivalent)
Units represent the creatures, programs, or entities that populate the multiverse. They are your primary offensive and defensive tools.

Characteristics:

Have Attack and Defense stats (e.g., 3/2).
Some are tied to energy types (e.g., a "Coding Unit" or "Creep Unit"), while others are Neutral Units.
Many have Keywords, which define their unique powers, such as:
Stealth: Cannot be targeted for attacks until it deals damage.
Overclock: Can attack immediately upon being summoned.
Decay: Gains power when an opponent loses energy.
Example Units:

Code Revenant (Coding)
2/3 for 3 Coding Energy
Effect: When Code Revenant dies, return it to your hand instead of your discard pile.
Drama Hound (Drama)
4/1 for 2 Drama Energy
Stealth. If it destroys a Unit, all opponents lose 1 Firewall.

3. Scripts (Spell Equivalent)
Scripts are one-time-use cards that represent instant actions, bursts of code, or dramatic moments. They can be used to alter the battlefield or change the flow of the game.

Characteristics:

Can be Offensive, Defensive, or Utility in nature.
Some Scripts are specific to energy types, while others are Colorless.
Example Scripts:

Patch Update (Coding)
Cost: 3 Coding Energy
Effect: Repair one Relic and give all Units +1 Defense until the end of the turn.
Viral Meme (Meme)
Cost: 2 Meme Energy
Effect: All Units gain "When this dies, deal 1 Firewall damage to its controller."

4. Relics (Artifact Equivalent)
Relics are powerful, persistent cards that represent ancient technologies, tools, or viral constructs. They stay in play until destroyed and provide long-term advantages.

Characteristics:

Can be targeted by effects that specifically destroy Relics.
Often enhance your deck’s core strategy or energy efficiency.
Example Relics:

Infinite Loop Drive (Coding)
Cost: 4 Coding Energy
Effect: Pay 2 Energy of any type to copy a Script you just played.
Oblivion Shard (Creep)
Cost: 3 Creep Energy
Effect: At the end of your turn, deal 1 damage to all Units and Firewalls.

5. Programs (Enchantment Equivalent)
Programs are long-lasting digital constructs that alter the rules of the game while they are active. Unlike Relics, they are intangible and harder to destroy.

Characteristics:

Typically tied to specific energy types.
Provide buffs, debuffs, or new mechanics for the game.
Example Programs:

Hacker’s Uplink (Coding)
Cost: 3 Coding Energy
Effect: At the start of your turn, draw one extra card if you control a Relic.
Trending Now (Meme)

6. Nodes (Land Equivalent)
Nodes generate energy and represent key locations or systems in the multiverse.

Code Repository (Coding Node)
Tap: Add 1 Coding Energy.
Tap: Pay 3 Coding Energy and draw 1 card.
